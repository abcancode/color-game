# Color Game
A JavaScript Color Game designed to help code newbies and pros alike brush up their RGB colour skills. 

## How it Works
In the colour game, a player is presented with different colour values based on red, green, and blue (RGB) pigments. Multiple colour boxes are displayed on the screen, each representing a different combination of RGB values. The player's task is to select the correct colour box that matches the given RGB values. The game features two difficulty levels: *Easy* mode, where fewer colour options are displayed for a simpler challenge, and *Hard* mode, which presents more colour choices, making it trickier to identify the correct match. The goal is to test and improve the playerâ€™s ability to recognize and distinguish colours based on their RGB compositions.
